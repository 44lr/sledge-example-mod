# Sledge
Sledge is an open source project that aims to bring full C# modding support to [Teardown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1167630/Teardown/).

The current goal is to port all of the already available Lua functions to C#, then add new / custom ones on top. (i.e. Voxel loading, changing gl uniforms, loading custom shaders, etc)
